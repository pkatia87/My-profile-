Bit of background about myself, my family and friends call me Paul for short and I am from a Fijian background but i was born here in Australia, im currently a PT aka Personal Trainer here in Sydney and i have a Certificate 3 and 4 in Fitness but have worked at Maccas for 10 years prior and was a Manager. My hobbies are mainly watching netflix, hanging out with my partner and playing sports mainly rugby league, i have played semi professional rugby league in Sydney for over 6 years and a favourite past-time for me would be hanging out with my family and catching up with them. English is my second language but at home we mainly speak Fijian and sometimes English as well

A fact that people might find interesting about me is that i can literally bark like a dog and i think people might find me weird 

What is my interest in IT? In this day and age where everything comes in a push of a button, i am always curious on how things are created and set up and always wanting to fix things like installing software, drivers, edit videos etc and i wont be satisfied till i know how to solve/fix things 

My interest in IT started when i was young and always surrounded in computers at home and my parents always make me sit on their lap and make me learn and type my name on the keyboard and a particular person that helped me sparked my interest was my Dad, he was always doing Uni work on the computer and using lots of software and fixing hardware made me curious to learn IT as a whole

I chose RMIT because it was flexible and it was available online and RMIT had the course which i wanted to study, i recommend online studying for those people who juggle lots of responsibility eg: Parents, carers etc 

What did i expected to learn? Just learning the basics of IT that will help me with my degree and learning the job skills and applying it in the workforce
