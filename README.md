Bit of background about myself, my family and friends call me Paul for short and I am from a Fijian background but i was born here in Australia, im currently a PT aka Personal Trainer here in Sydney and i have a Certificate 3 and 4 in Fitness but have worked at Maccas for 10 years prior and was a Manager. My hobbies are mainly watching netflix, hanging out with my partner and playing sports mainly rugby league, i have played semi professional rugby league in Sydney for over 6 years and a favourite past-time for me would be hanging out with my family and catching up with them. English is my second language but at home we mainly speak Fijian and sometimes English as well

A fact that people might find interesting about me is that i can literally bark like a dog and i think people might find me weird
