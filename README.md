Bit of background about myself, my family and friends call me Paul for short and I am from a Fijian background but i was born here in Australia, im currently a PT aka Personal Trainer here in Sydney and i have a Certificate 3 and 4 in Fitness but have worked at Maccas for 10 years prior and was a Manager. My hobbies are mainly watching netflix, hanging out with my partner and playing sports mainly rugby league, i have played semi professional rugby league in Sydney for over 6 years and a favourite past-time for me would be hanging out with my family and catching up with them. English is my second language but at home we mainly speak Fijian and sometimes English as well

A fact that people might find interesting about me is that i can literally bark like a dog and i think people might find me weird 

What is my interest in IT? In this day and age where everything comes in a push of a button, i am always curious on how things are created and set up and always wanting to fix things like installing software, drivers, edit videos etc and i wont be satisfied till i know how to solve/fix things 

My interest in IT started when i was young and always surrounded in computers at home and my parents always make me sit on their lap and make me learn and type my name on the keyboard and a particular person that helped me sparked my interest was my Dad, he was always doing Uni work on the computer and using lots of software and fixing hardware made me curious to learn IT as a whole

I chose RMIT because it was flexible and it was available online and RMIT had the course which i wanted to study, i recommend online studying for those people who juggle lots of responsibility eg: Parents, carers etc 

What did i expected to learn? Just learning the basics of IT that will help me with my degree and learning the job skills and applying it in the workforce

PERSONAL PROFILE

Results for Myers-Briggs 

ESFP: Extraverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving - they are pretty much the outgoing, life of the party and the fun type of person, they love being around people, centre of attention, loves variations of things. They can get distracted very easily but doesnt like confrontation and they are trustworthy 

Results for Online Learning Style: Tactile/Kinesthetic learner - they are very hands-on and they learn through by doing activities in order to solve an answer and they are always moving out and about and sense of touch is important for them 

Results for the another online test of my choice: I chose a creativity test and i had Creativity is a release - using my creativity to release emotions built up and putting them into physical form like painting, singing, write poems etc 

RESULTS SUMMARY:

The results has shown that i am a very outgoing person and has a very hands on learning approach and sticking to routine can be tough but it is something i will get used to eventually. I can be stand off-ish sometimes in a new environment or crowd but once i get out of my shell and be more comfortable, i can be valuable in a team environment. Everyone else can be a bit different and learning their behaviour and adapting when needed. In a group setting, you would like to get everyone involved and if you nail everyone's behavioural style, you can get the most of the group and get more answers and the importance of working collectively in a team to get achieve something 


PROJECT IDEA

OVERVIEW:

Developing a game using Unity 
The game i will be developing is Rugby Goal Kicking, from various spots on the rugby field ranging from 22, 40 and 50 metres out either towards the far left or right side of the field

To make the game more interesting i will add in things like bonus points for kicking 5 goals in a row, you only have 4 balls to play with – if you miss 2 consecutive goals – you will lose a ball so you have 3 balls left now 

I will be adding wind direction as well to provide resistance with the kicking and judging the direction and with practice and patience, this game will be great for all ages and user-friendly

MOTIVATION

Why the game is useful: 
•	You get to play with your family and friends – more bonding time with everyone 
•	Hand-eye co-ordination improvement for kids
•	They develop new skills 
•	Learn how to add points – good for kids and help them with their maths 
•	Good stress reliever  for some people – another form of relaxation 
•	Helps combat depression for some people 

The graphics is great and can be either in 2D or in 3D form and comes in Day/night mode simulation
